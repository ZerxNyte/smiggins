  <summary><h2 style="display: inline">How to run locally</summary>

  1. Clone the github repo or download the files

  2. With python, install the needed libraries (`python3 -m pip install --upgrade django django-ninja ensure-file`, `py -m ...`
  on windows)

  3. Create the `_api_keys.py` file:
      ```bash
      touch ~/social-media-thing/smiggins/backend/_api_keys.py
      echo "auth_key = b'some random text this can be anything'" > ~/social-media-thing/smiggins/backend/_api_keys.py
      ```
      if you're on Windows then fuck you figure it out yourself
  4. In the folder REPO_BASE/smiggins run the command `python3 manage.py migrate`
  (`py ...` for windows)

  5. Then, to start the server, run `python3 manage.py runserver` (`py ...` on
  windows still). If you want to start the server but already have the files,
  just do this step again. When updating versions, repeat step four too assuming
  you don't delete the `_api_keys.py` file, then you'd have to do step three
  again too.

  <summary><h2 style="display: inline">How to set up the server on PythonAnywhere (using a venv)</h2></summary>

  1. Create a venv (the name can be anything). if you already have one feel free
  to skip this step
      ```bash
      mkvirtualenv VENV_NAME --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 # the VENV_NAME can be anything
      ```

  2. On the webapp setup page, create a new webapp. If you already have one,
  delete it and recreate it if it has a different config. You should click the
  following buttons in this order:
      - Add a new web app
      - Next
      - Manual configuration
      - Python 3.X (it doesn't matter)
      - Next

  3. On the webapp dashboard, in the "Virtualenv" section, you are going to want
  to enter the path to your venv. It should be `/home/USERNAME/.virtualenvs/VENV_NAME`.

  4. Click the "Start a console on this virtualenv" button to create a console
  in the venv. Then install needed libraries.
      ```bash
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip django django-ninja ensure-file
      ```

  5. Clone the github repo
      ```bash
      cd ~
      git clone https://github.com/trinkey/social-media-thing.git
      # Optional: Change branch
      git switch branch-name
      ```

  6. Open the file at `/var/www/USERNAME_pythonanywhere_com.wgsi.py` and put the
  following python code, replacing "USERNAME" with your PythonAnywhere username:
      ```py
      import os
      import sys

      path = '/home/USERNAME/social-media-thing/smiggins'
      if path not in sys.path:
          sys.path.append(path)

      os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'smiggins.settings'

      from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
      application = get_wsgi_application()
      ```

  7. Back on the webapp dashboard, in the "Static Files" section, make an entry
  for `/static/` with the path set to `/home/USERNAME/social-media-thing/smiggins/collected-static`

  8. In the file at `/home/USERNAME/social-media-thing/smiggins/backend/_settings.py`,
  make sure the following settings are set:
      - debug: `False`

  9. Create the `_api_keys.py` file:
      ```bash
      touch ~/social-media-thing/smiggins/backend/_api_keys.py
      echo "auth_key = b'some random text this can be anything'" > ~/social-media-thing/smiggins/backend/_api_keys.py
      ```

  10. In your venv console, run the following commands to create the database
  and setup the static files:
      ```bash
      cd ~/social-media-thing/smiggins
      python manage.py collectstatic
      python manage.py migrate
      ```

      path = '/home/USERNAME/social-media-thing/smiggins'
      if path not in sys.path:

      os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'smiggins.settings'

      from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
      application = get_wsgi_application()
      ```
      This file can be went to with the url
      https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/USERNAME/files/var/www/USERNAME_pythonanywhere_com.wgsi.py

      ```

  10. In your venv console, run the following commands to create the database
  and setup the static files:
      ```bash
